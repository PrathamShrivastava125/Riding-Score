# 🏍️ Riding Score – Telemetry-Based Engagement Metric

This project showcases a custom-built **Riding Score** system developed at **Ajjas** to gamify rider behavior and improve user engagement. It uses vehicle telemetry data to calculate a daily score based on how safely and smoothly a ride is completed.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal was to create a scoring model that:
- Encourages safer riding through behavioral feedback
- Boosts app engagement with gamified daily insights
- Normalizes scoring across varying ride lengths and hardware types
- Enables actionable insights for users, support teams, and business stakeholders

---

## 🔍 Key Concepts

The score is based on multiple ride behavior signals tracked via onboard devices, including events like harsh acceleration and sudden braking. These events are processed server-side to generate a **daily score between 25 and 100**, which reflects the quality of the ride.

A dynamic **scaling factor** is applied based on distance traveled to ensure fair comparisons between short and long rides.

## 🧠 My Contributions

- **Defined the scoring logic and behavior patterns** in collaboration with product and engineering teams  
- Documented technical logic and parameters for backend integration  
- **Field-tested scoring accuracy** on my personal **Dominar 400**, simulating a variety of real-world riding styles  
- Assisted in validating the output against expected patterns and edge cases  
- Aligned the scoring design with broader business goals around **user retention and in-app gamification**

## 🧪 Real-World Validation

To ensure realism, I tested the system on actual rides using diverse behaviors (speed bursts, quick turns, braking intensity). The final score output matched expectations and highlighted areas for rider improvement — proving the score’s value beyond just a number.

## 🚀 Why This Matters

This project bridges **product thinking**, **data modeling**, and **real-world telemetry**, demonstrating my ability to:
- Convert raw behavior data into a meaningful user metric  
- Align analytics with engagement goals  
- Collaborate across technical and non-technical teams to ship validated, user-facing features

📌 This is a strong representation of applied data thinking, combining logic design, experimentation, and cross-functional collaboration in a real-world product setting.
